## Day 1: Data Types

## What I learnt

- Numbers
- Strings
- Booleans
- Lists
- Tuples
- Sets
- Dictionaries

## Numbers

Numbers are used to represent integers, floating point numbers, and complex numbers.

- Integers

```python
>>> 1
1
>>> 2
2
```

- Floats: Floating point numbers are represented in Python using decimal points. Also known as real numbers.

  ```python
  >>> 1.1
  1.1
  ```

- Complex Numbers: Complex numbers are written in the form, x + yj, where x is the real part and y is the imaginary part.

  ```python
  >>> 1 + 2j
  (1+2j)
  ```

## Strings

Strings are used to represent text data, the text is given under quote marks. Python treats single quotes the same as double quotes.

- Single Quotes
- Double Quotes
- Triple Quotes: Triple quotes are used to span the string across multiple lines.

```python
>>> 'Hello World'
'Hello World'
>>> "Hello World"
'Hello World'
>>> """Hello World"""
'Hello World'
```

- String Concatenation: Strings can be concatenated (glued together) with the + operator, and repeated with \*:

```python
>>> 'Hello' + 'World'
'HelloWorld'
>>> 'Hello' * 3
'HelloHelloHello'
```

- String Slicing: Strings can be sliced (subscripted), with the syntax [start:stop:step]. If start is omitted, it is default to 0. If stop is omitted, it is default to the end of the string. If step is omitted, it is default to 1.

```python
>>> word = 'Python'
>>> word[0]  # character in position 0
'P'
>>> word[5]  # character in position 5
'n'
>>> word[-1]  # last character
'n'
>>> word[-2]  # second-last character
'o'
>>> word[0:2]  # characters from position 0 (included) to 2 (excluded)
'Py'
>>> word[2:5]  # characters from position 2 (included) to 5 (excluded)
'tho'
>>> word[:2] + word[2:]
'Python'
```

- String Methods : Strings have a bunch of useful methods. Some of them are listed below.

```python
>>> word = 'Python'
>>> word.upper()
'PYTHON'
>>> word.lower()
'python'
>>> word.startswith('P')
True
>>> word.endswith('n')
True
```

You can find more string methods [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods).

## Booleans

Booleans represent one of two values: True or False.

```python
>>> True
True
>>> False
False
```

## Lists

A list is a collection of items in a particular order.
You can make a list that includes the letters of the alphabet, the digits from 0-9.
You can put anything you want into a list, and the items in your list don't have to be related in any particular way.
The syntax for defining a list is to enclose the items in square brackets, with commas between them.

```python
>>> [1, 2, 3]
[1, 2, 3]
>>> ['Hello', 'World']
['Hello', 'World']
>>> [1, 'Hello', 2.5]
[1, 'Hello', 2.5]
```

Characteristics of Lists:

- Ordered
- Mutable
- Allows Duplicate Elements

### Example of List and Manipulating it

```python
bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
 print(bicycles)
 print(bicycles[0])
```

- Slicing a list => When slicing a list, just as strings, it has 3 parts i.e [start:stop:stepover]

```python
	print(bicycles[1:3])
```

- Duplicating a list - [:] is used to create an entirely new copy of the existing list

````python
	new_bicycles = bicycles[1::2]
	new_bicycles[0] = 'seat'
	print(new_bicycles)
	print(bicycles)

	```

- Matrix: A matrix is a two-dimensional data structure that can store numbers or other types of data ie it's a liat that stores another list inside of them.

### Example of Matrix

```python
	matrix = [
	    [1, 2, 3],
	    [4, 5, 6],
	    [7, 8, 9]
	]

	print(matrix[2][0])
	```

### List Methods

- append() => This method adds an item to the end of the list

```python
 bicycles.append('word')
````

- insert() => This method adds an item at a specific index

```python
bicycles.insert(0, 'shoo')
```

- extend() => This method adds multiple items to the end of the list

```python
bicycles.extend(['word2', 'word3'])
```

- remove() => This method removes an item from the list by its value and not by its index

```python
bicycles.remove('word2')
```

- pop() => This method removes the last item from the list and returns the popped item

```python
new_bask = bicycles.pop(0)
```

- clear() => This method removes all the items from the list and returns an empty list

```python
bicycles.clear()
```

- index() => This method returns the index of the first item with the specified value and returns an error if the value is not found

- You can learn more about the index method [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists)

```python
print(bicycles.index('word3'))
```

- count() => This method returns the number of times the specified value appears in the list

```python
print(bicycles.count('word3'))
```

### Common List Patterns

```python
bicycles.sort()
bicycles.reverse()

print(bicycles[::-1]) # This is used to reverse a list and it creates a new copy of the list
print(bicycles)

```

### List Unpacking: This is used to assign multiple variables at once

```python
a, b, c, *rest, d = bicycles

print(rest)

print(d)
```

### Looping through a list

- For Loop

```python
for bicycle in bicycles:
    print(bicycle)
```

- Remove duplicates from a list

```python
names = ['John', 'Bob', 'Mosh', 'Sarah', 'Mosh', 'John', 'Anne', 'Jane', 'Bob', 'Anne']

duplicate_names = []
unique_names = []

for name in names:
    if name not in unique_names:
        unique_names.append(name)
    else:
        duplicate_names.append(name)
print(unique_names)
print(duplicate_names)


pictures = [
[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0],
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
]

for row in pictures:
    for pixels in row:
        if pixels == 1:
            print('\*', end='')
        else:
            print(' ', end='')
    print('') # This is used to print a new line after each row
```

- While Loop

```python
 i = 0
 while i < len(bicycles):
    print(bicycles[i])
    i += 1
```

- Looping through a list of dictionaries

```python
users = [{'username': 'Jobizil', 'email': 'jobizil@email.com','age': 26},
{'username': 'Quill', 'email': 'quill@email.com', 'age': 22}]

for user in users:
    print(user['username'])
```

### List Comprehension: This is used to create a new list from an existing list

```python
new_list = [expression for item in list if conditional]
new_list = [item['email'] for item in users]
 print(new_list)
```

### List Comprehension with if statement

```python
new_list = [item['email'] for item in users if item['age'] > 25]
print(new_list)
```

## Tuples: Just like Lists, Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable but they are stored within brackets (elements).

```Python
    >>> (1, 2, 3)
    (1, 2, 3)
    >>> ('Hello', 'World')
    ('Hello', 'World')
    >>> (1, 'Hello', 2.5)
    (1, 'Hello', 2.5)
```

Characteristics of Tuple:

- Ordered
- Immutable
- Allows Duplicate Elements

Tuple Methods: You can learn more about the tuple methods [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences)

## Sets

A set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. In Python, sets are written with curly brackets.

```python
>>> {1, 2, 3}
{1, 2, 3}
>>> {'Hello', 'World'}
{'Hello', 'World'}
>>> {1, 'Hello', 2.5}
{1, 'Hello', 2.5}
```

Characteristics of Sets:

- Unordered
- Mutable
- Does Not Allow Duplicate Elements

### Example of a set

```python
fruits = {'apple', 'orange', 'apple', 'grape', 'pear', 'banana'}
fruits_2 = {'babana', 'pawpaw', 'apple', 'orange', 'pear', 'banana', 'mango'}
print(fruits)
```

### Common Set Patterns

- Convert a list to a set

```python
 fruits_list = ['apple', 'orange', 'apple', 'grape', 'pear', 'banana']
 fruits_set = set(fruits_list)
 print(list(fruits_set))
```

- Remove duplicates from a list

```python
 fruits_list = ['apple', 'orange', 'apple', 'grape', 'pear', 'banana']
fruits_set = set(fruits_list)
print(list(fruits_set))
```

- Find the intersection of two lists

```python
fruits_list = ['apple', 'orange', 'apple', 'grape', 'pear', 'banana']

fruits_list_2 = ['apple', 'orange', 'apple', 'grape', 'pear', 'banana', 'mango']

 fruits_set = set(fruits_list)
 fruits_set_2 = set(fruits_list_2)

 print(fruits_set.intersection(fruits_set_2))

```

- Find the difference between two lists

```python
print(fruits_set.difference(fruits_set_2))
print(fruits_set_2.difference(fruits_set))
```

- Find the union of two lists

```python
print(fruits_set.union(fruits_set_2))
```

### Set Methods

- add() => This method adds an element to the set

```python
fruits.add('mango')
 print(fruits)
```

- clear() => This method removes all the elements from the set

```python
fruits.clear()
 print(fruits)
```

- copy() => This method returns a copy of the set

```python
fruits_copy = fruits.copy()
 print(fruits_copy)
```

- difference() => This method returns a set containing the difference between two or more sets

```python
print(fruits.difference(fruits_2))
print(fruits_2.difference(fruits))
```

- difference_update() => This method removes the items in this set that are also included in another, specified set and returns a set

```python
print(fruits.difference_update(fruits_2))
print(fruits)
```

- discard() => This method removes the specified element from the set

```python
fruits.discard('apple')
print(fruits)
```

- intersection() => This method returns a set that contains the similarity between two or more sets

```python
print(fruits.intersection(fruits_2))
```

- intersection_update() => This method removes the items in this set that are not present in other, specified set(s) and returns a set

```python
print(fruits.intersection_update(fruits_2))
```

- isdisjoint() => This method returns True if two sets have a null intersection

```python
print(fruits.isdisjoint(fruits_2))
```

- issubset() => This method returns True if another set contains this set

```python
print(fruits.issubset(fruits_2))
print(fruits_2.issubset(fruits))
```

- issuperset() => This method returns True if this set contains another set

```python
print(fruits.issuperset(fruits_2))
print(fruits_2.issuperset(fruits))
```

- union() => This method returns a set that contains all items from the original set, and all items from the specified sets

```python
print(fruits.union(fruits_2))
```

You can learn more about the set methods [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets)

## Dictionaries

A dictionary in Python is a collection of key-value pairs usually unordered. Each key is connected to a value, and you can use a key to access the value associated with that key. A key's value can be a number, a string, a list, or even another dictionary. In fact, you can use any object that you can create in Python as a value in a dictionary.
They store data values in key:value pairs within curly braces {elements}.

```python
>>> {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}
{'name': 'John', 'age': 30}
>>> {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'name': 'Jane'}
{'name': 'Jane', 'age': 30}
```

Characteristics of Dictionaries:

- Unordered
- Mutable
- Does Not Allow Duplicate Keys

### Example of a dictionary

```python
user = {'username': 'Jobizil',
        'email': 'jobizil@email.com',
        'age': 25,
        'color': 'blue',
        'is_active': True,
        'is_admin': True,
        'is_staff': False,
        }
 print(user['username'])
```

### Dictionary Methods

- get() => This method returns the value of the specified key

```python
  print(user.get('username'))
```

- keys() => This method returns a list of all the keys in the dictionary

```python
  print(user.keys())
  print(user.values())
```

- items() => This method returns a list of tuples containing the key-value pairs

```python
  print(user.items())
```

- clear() => This method removes all the items from the dictionary and returns an empty dictionary

```python
  print(user.clear())
```

- pop() => This method removes the item with the specified key name and returns the value of the removed item

```python
  print(user.pop('username'))
```

- popitem() => This method removes the last inserted item and returns a tuple containing the key-value pair of the removed item

```python
  print(user.popitem())
```

- copy() => This method returns a copy of the dictionary

```python
  user_2 = user.copy()
  print(user_2)
```

- update() => This method updates the dictionary with the specified key-value pairs

```python
  user.update({'username': 'Quill', 'email': 'quill@email.com'})
  user_3 = user.copy()
  print(user_3)
```

Read more about dictionary methods [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries)

### Common Dictionary Patterns

- Looping through a dictionary

      ```python

  for key, value in user.items():
  print(f'Key: {key}')
  print(f'Value: {value}')

  ```

  ```

- Looping through a dictionary keys

  ````python
  for key in user.keys():
      print(key)
      ```

  ````

- Looping through a dictionary values

  ```python
  for value in user.values():
  print(value)
  ```

- Dictionary Comprehension:

Dictionary comprehension is a way to create a dictionary in a single line of code. It is a combination of a for loop and a dictionary.

### Example of Dictionary Comprehension

    ```python
    squared = {num: num**2 for num in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}
     print(squared)
    ```

- Dictionary Comprehension with conditional logic

Dictionary comprehension with conditional logic is a way to create a dictionary in a single line of code. It is a combination of a for loop, a conditional statement and a dictionary.

### Example of Dictionary Comprehension with conditional logic

    ```python
    squared = {num: num**2 for num in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] if num % 2 == 0}
    print(squared)
    ```
