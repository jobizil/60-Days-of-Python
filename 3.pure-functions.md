## Day 3: Functional Programming

## What I learnt

- Pure Functions
- Immutability
- Built-in Functions

Functional Programming is a programming paradigm - a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs - that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

## Pure Functions

Pure functions are functions that return the same result if given the same arguments, and do not cause any observable side effects.

### Example

```python
def multiply_by2(items):
    new_list = []
    for item in items:
        new_list.append(item\*2)
    return new_list

print(multiply_by2([1, 2, 3]))
```

### Benefits of Pure Functions

- 1. They are easier to test.
- 2. They are easier to reason about.
- 3. They are easier to compose.
- 4. They are easier to parallelize.

## Immutability

In functional programming, immutability is the absence of state change over time. If a program is stateless, then it's output is only determined by its input.

### Example

```python
a = 2
b = a
print(a)
print(b)
a = 3
print(a)
print(b)
```

### Example 2

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list_copy = my_list
print(my_list)
print(my_list_copy)
my_list.append(4)
print(my_list)
print(my_list_copy)
```

> The first example shows that the variable b is a copy of a. The second example shows that the variable my_list_copy is a reference to my_list. This is because lists are mutable. If we want to make a copy of a list, we can use the list() function.

## Built-in Functions

Some built-in functions that return new lists are: map(), filter(), and zip(). These functions do not change the original list.

- map(): The map() function applies a function to every item in an iterable and returns a new iterable with the results. The map() function takes two parameters:

  - **fun** : It is a function to which map passes each element of given iterable.
  - **iter** : It is a iterable which is to be mapped.

  It is good to know that the map function separates the function from the data(iterable) which is a very important concept in functional programming.

### Examples

- 1. Using map on a list to get the double of each element

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
def myltiplyElement(li):
  return li * 2
mapped_list = map(myltiplyElement, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

#print(list(mapped_list))
#print(tuple(mapped_list))
#print(set(mapped_list))

```

- 2. Using map on a set to get the length of each element

```python
def get_length(item):
return len(item)

length_of_element = map(
get_length, {'apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'apple', 'mango'})
print(list(length_of_element))
```

- 3. Using map on a dictionary to get the length of each key

```python
def item_length(item):
  return len(item)

length_of_key = map(item_length, {'apple': 1, 'banana': 2, 'orange': 3})
print(list(length_of_key))
```

- filter(): The filter() function creates a new list with only the items that return true when passed into a function. Just like the map function, the filter() function takes two parameters:
  **fun**: It is a function to which filter passes each element of given iterable.
  **iter**: It is a iterable which is to be filtered.

### Example

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

def is_even(item):
  return item % 2 == 0

even_list = filter(is_even, my_list)
print(list(even_list))
```

- zip(): The zip() function ta kes iterables (can be zero or more), aggregates them in a tuple, and return it.
  The syntax of zip() is: zip(\*iterables). This function takes iterables as arguments and returns an iterator. The returned iterator generates a series of tuples containing elements from each iterable. The iterator stops when the shortest input iterable is exhausted.

### Example

```python
username = ['john', 'jane', 'joe', 'josh']
email = ['john@email.com', 'jane@email.com', 'joe@email.com']

print(set(zip(username, email)))

# Example 2

names = ['john', 'jane', 'joe', 'josh']
ages = [23, 24, 25, 26]
heights = [180, 175, 178, 182]

print(list(zip(names, ages, heights)))

```

### Exercise

# 1 Capitalize all of the pet names and print the list

my_pets = ['sisi', 'bibi', 'titi', 'carla']

# 2 Zip the 2 lists into a list of tuples, but sort the numbers from lowest to highest.

my_strings = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
my_numbers = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

# 3 Filter the scores that pass over 50%

scores = [73, 20, 65, 19, 76, 100, 88]
